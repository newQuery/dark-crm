- ✅ Ensure responsive layout (desktop/tablet), polished micro-interactions, and testability via data-testid attributes
- ✅ Use UUID identifiers and timezone-aware datetimes throughout
- ✅ Provide dedicated detail pages with enhanced functionality for all entities
- ✅ Replace all view dialogs with dedicated detail pages for better UX
- ✅ Implement deliverables management for projects
- ✅ Enable PDF invoice generation with professional formatting and logo

**Next Objectives (Phase 5):**
- Advanced testing and polish
- Performance optimization

## 3) UI/UX Design Guidelines (Applied)
Reference: /app/design_guidelines.md

- Color System (per guidelines):
  - Primary: #00C676; Accent: #39FF8E; Base backgrounds: #0B0F10/#0E1417
  - Tokens injected into CSS: --primary, --primary-accent, --bg-base, --fg-primary, etc.
  - Per rule: Gradients limited to <20% viewport; only for login/hero overlays
- Typography: Space Grotesk (headings), Inter (body), Roboto Mono (code)
- Components: Use shadcn/ui exclusively for forms, dialogs, toasts, tables, etc.
- Icons: lucide-react
- Motion: Specific transitions (no transition: all). Hover/active/focus-visible states on all interactive elements
- Data states: explicit loading (skeleton), empty, and error states for each data view
- Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast, keyboard operable menus/dialogs/forms
- Testing attributes: every interactive/critical info element has data-testid

## 4) Implementation Steps (Phased)

### Phase 1 – Full MVP Implementation (COMPLETED ✅)
Backend (FastAPI):
- Auth:
  - POST /api/auth/login (JWT issuance), GET /api/auth/me
  - bcrypt password hashing, JWT via python-jose; secure and stateless
  - Seed default admin user (UUID id) if absent
- Data Models (MongoDB, UUIDs, tz-aware datetimes):
  - Client: id, name, email, company, phone, project_ids[], created_at, updated_at
  - Project: id, title, client_id, status, deadline, total_value, deliverables[], created_at, updated_at
  - Invoice: id, number, client_id, project_id, amount, currency, status (paid/pending/overdue), due_date, issued_date, paid_at, stripe_payment_intent_id, created_at, updated_at
  - Payment: id, invoice_id, client_id, amount, currency, status, stripe_charge_id/intent_id, created_at
  - Activity: id, type, entity_type, entity_id, message, actor, timestamp
  - Deliverable: id, name, file_url, uploaded_at
- CRUD Endpoints (all prefixed with /api):
  - /clients [GET/POST], /clients/{id} [GET/PATCH/DELETE]
  - /projects [GET/POST], /projects/{id} [GET/PATCH/DELETE]
  - /invoices [GET/POST], /invoices/{id} [GET/PATCH/DELETE]
  - /payments [GET] (derived + Stripe sync), /metrics [GET] (aggregate KPIs), /activity [GET]
- Stripe Integration:
  - POST /api/payments/intent -> create PaymentIntent for an invoice (test mode)
  - GET /api/payments/transactions -> list recent Stripe charges/payment_intents
  - Webhooks: /api/stripe/webhook -> update invoice/payment status (payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded)
- Aggregations:
  - KPIs for Dashboard: total revenue (paid invoices sum), active projects count, client count

Frontend (React + React Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui):
- App Shell: Left sidebar (logo + nav), topbar, content area; dark theme tokens loaded in index.css
- Pages:
  - Login: text-logo, gradient overlay (<20%), email/password form
  - Dashboard: Stat cards, Revenue BarChart, Payments LineChart, Recent Activity
  - Projects: Table + Create/Edit dialog
  - Clients: Search + Table + Add/Edit sheet/dialog
  - Invoices: Tabs (All/Paid/Pending/Overdue) + Table + New Invoice dialog
  - Payments: Transactions list + date filter; payout summaries
- State & Data:
  - Axios API layer using REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL + /api prefix
  - AuthContext storing JWT; Protected routes; attach Bearer token
  - Loading/empty/error states
- Visuals:
  - Recharts (dark theme via CSS tokens); Framer Motion for entrance animations
  - Sonner for toasts; lucide-react icons

Tooling & Ops:
- Use yarn add for dependencies (no npm).
- Supervisor-managed services; logs at /var/log/supervisor/*

## 5) Technical Details

Architecture & Environment:
- Frontend -> Backend: process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL + /api
- Backend -> MongoDB: MONGO_URL (existing). Preserve and never change this variable name/value.
- Backend binding: 0.0.0.0:8001
- Ingress: /api/* -> backend; others -> frontend

Security:
- JWT with HS256; tokens expire (e.g., 24h); refresh optional later
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt; no plaintext storage
- CORS origins from env CORS_ORIGINS (comma-separated)
- Never log secrets; avoid echoing keys in logs

Stripe:
- Backend-only usage of Secret key; Frontend uses publishable key only when needed (not required for server-created payment intents + server confirmation)
- ENV (backend/.env):
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<set in env, do not hardcode>
  - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<to be added once webhook is configured>
- ENV (frontend/.env):
  - REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<set in env, do not hardcode>
- Endpoints:
  - POST /api/payments/intent { invoice_id } -> returns client_secret
  - GET /api/payments/transactions -> server lists latest payment_intents/charges and maps to invoices
  - POST /api/stripe/webhook -> validate signature, update invoice/payment

Data Models (Mongo collections – all IDs are UUID strings):
- users: { id, email, password_hash, name, role, created_at }
- clients: { id, name, email, company, phone, project_ids[], created_at, updated_at }
- projects: { id, title, client_id, status, deadline, total_value, deliverables[], created_at, updated_at }
  - deliverables: [{ id, name, file_url, uploaded_at }]
- invoices: { id, number, client_id, project_id, amount, currency, status, due_date, issued_date, paid_at, stripe_payment_intent_id, created_at, updated_at }
- payments: { id, invoice_id, client_id, amount, currency, status, stripe_charge_id, stripe_payment_intent_id, created_at }
- activity: { id, type, entity_type, entity_id, actor, message, timestamp }

API Surface (all prefixed /api):
- Auth: POST /auth/login, GET /auth/me
- Clients: GET/POST /clients; GET/PATCH/DELETE /clients/{id}
- Projects: GET/POST /projects; GET/PATCH/DELETE /projects/{id}
  - POST /projects/{id}/deliverables (add deliverable)
  - GET /projects/{id}/deliverables (list deliverables)
  - DELETE /projects/{id}/deliverables/{deliverable_id} (remove deliverable)
- Invoices: GET/POST /invoices; GET/PATCH/DELETE /invoices/{id}
  - GET /invoices/{id}/pdf (download PDF)
- Payments: GET /payments, POST /payments/intent
- Metrics: GET /metrics (revenue, activeProjects, clientsCount, mrr)
- Activity: GET /activity (recent timeline)

Frontend Routing (React Router):
- /login (public)
- / (redirect -> /dashboard)
- /dashboard (protected)
- /projects (protected) - Projects list
- /projects/:id (protected) - Project detail page
- /clients (protected) - Clients list
- /clients/:id (protected) - Client detail page
- /invoices (protected) - Invoices list
- /invoices/:id (protected) - Invoice detail page
- /payments (protected) - Payments list
- /payments/:id (protected) - Payment detail page

Dependencies:
- Backend: fastapi, uvicorn, motor, pymongo, stripe, python-jose[cryptography], passlib[bcrypt], python-multipart, websockets, reportlab, pillow
- Frontend: react, react-dom, react-router-dom, axios, recharts, framer-motion, sonner, lucide-react, @fontsource/space-grotesk, @fontsource/inter, tailwindcss, shadcn/ui components

Testing & QA:
- Testing agent: /app/test_reports/iteration_2.json (97.5% success rate)
- Backend test suite: /app/backend_test.py
- Compile check (frontend): esbuild src/ --loader:.js=jsx --bundle --outfile=/dev/null
- Logs: tail -n 50 /var/log/supervisor/frontend.*.log /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log
- Services: supervisorctl status (all services running)
