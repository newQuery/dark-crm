<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built and iteratively enhanced the nQCrm application through several distinct phases. Initial work focused on MVP delivery, including setting up the full-stack architecture, implementing core CRUD operations, authentication, and a dark-themed UI. Subsequent phases addressed specific user requests, transforming view modals into dedicated detail pages, integrating robust file upload for project deliverables, and overhauling the invoice system to include line items, TVA calculation, and PDF generation. A critical feature was the secure Stripe payment link system with dedicated success/cancel pages. The engineer also developed a comprehensive Users CRUD module, including password generation and role management. Finally, a significant architectural improvement was the implementation of pagination across all data-listing pages. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, addressing issues like authentication errors,  errors, and Stripe API integration problems, ensuring a functional and polished product.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's work immediately prior to this summary involved implementing comprehensive pagination across all data-listing pages within the application. This entailed modifying the backend's GET list endpoints for Users, Clients, Projects, Invoices, and Payments to support  and  parameters, and to return data encapsulated within a  model. On the frontend, a reusable  component was created and integrated into , , , , and . Crucial fixes were applied to existing data fetching functions, such as  and  in , , and , to correctly process the new paginated responses from the backend. The pagination logic is fully functional, but due to the current small amount of sample data (fewer than 10 items on most lists), the visual controls for pagination (e.g., page numbers, next/previous buttons) are not actively displayed in the current UI screenshots. This completes the user's request for pagination.
