The AI engineer successfully initiated the nQCrm project, progressing through multiple phases. It started by clarifying user requirements, setting up the basic environment, and obtaining design guidelines. Phase 1 focused on building the MVP, including comprehensive backend (JWT auth, MongoDB, CRUD, Stripe, metrics) and frontend (React app shell, routing, pages, design tokens) functionality. Extensive testing confirmed the core application's stability.

Phase 2 enhanced the application with real-time capabilities by implementing Stripe webhooks, activity logging, and WebSocket support for dynamic dashboard updates. Phase 3 addressed user feedback by adding full CRUD action buttons and corresponding dialogs across all entity tables. A subsequent fix improved button styling for better visibility. The current phase (Phase 4) is focused on transforming view dialogs into dedicated detail pages, integrating deliverables management for projects, and enabling PDF invoice generation, marking a shift towards more robust administrative features and improved UX.

<product_requirements>
The user requested nQCrm, a modern CRM dashboard web application with a dark theme inspired by green accents (#00C676 / #39FF8E), clean typography, high contrast cards, and soft shadows, with the logo in the sidebar or top-left.

**Core Features:**
*   **Dashboard Overview:** Display total revenue, active projects, client count, and a recent activity feed.
*   **Projects Module:** CRUD for projects (title, client, deadline, status, total value).
*   **Clients Module:** CRUD for clients (name, email, company, phone, associated projects).
*   **Invoices Module:** Generate and manage invoices linked to clients/projects, with status (paid, pending, overdue).
*   **Payments Module:** Stripe API integration for transactions, payments from invoices, history, and payout summaries.

**Technical & Design Preferences:**
*   Responsive layout (desktop/tablet).
*   Sidebar navigation with icons (Dashboard, Projects, Clients, Invoices, Payments).
*   Real-time updates (Livewire or similar).
*   API-ready backend for mobile.
*   User authentication (email/password, 2FA optional).

**Bonus UI Details:**
*   Subtle animations (card transitions, hover effects).
*   Data visualizations (bar charts for revenue, line charts for payments).
*   Sleek, professional, futuristic tone.

**Additional User Requests (Implemented):**
*   Stripe API keys (pk_test_..., sk_test_...).
*   Logo branding (1.png, 5.png).
*   Buttons for update/create/view detail for each admin entity.
*   Improved styling for create and login buttons.

**Current Enhancements (Phase 4):**
*   Transform view modals into dedicated detail pages for all CRUD entities (Projects, Clients, Invoices, Payments).
*   Project Detail Page: Add deliverables management (add, list, remove downloads).
*   Invoice Detail Page: Include a button for downloading a professional PDF invoice with the logo.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the middle of Phase 4, focusing on enhancing CRUD actions by replacing modal-based View Detail functionality with dedicated detail pages. The backend has been updated to include deliverable management endpoints for projects and a PDF invoice generation endpoint, along with the necessary  dependency. On the frontend, new detail pages (, , , ) have been created, and  has been updated to include routing for these pages.

Immediately before this summary request, the engineer was actively refactoring the  and  components. This involves removing the old  sections and updating the View action buttons to use React Router's  function to redirect to the new  and  detail pages, respectively. The refactoring of  for this transition is still in progress.
